<dt>Fate series</dt>
<dd>This game series is full of heroes from around the world fighting to the brink of death. It is just as fun as it is teaching.</dd>
<dt>Mortal kombat</dt>
<dd>The kombat games have been with us since long ago and the characters just keep improving along the game itself.</dd>
<dt>street fighter</dt>
<dd>Now the street fighters have been entertaining people of all ages and genders since the good old arcade days and they just keep gaining more and more players.</dd>
